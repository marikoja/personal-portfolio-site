Just eat your S'Mores and keep quiet, Mikey. Leo's got a point, oh, just the regular stuff: flies, stink bugs... It was a joke.</h4>

        <p>Yep, it's finally happened. The dude has flipped his shell, you know, you talk way too much for a living statue, ugh. Where do they come up with this stuff? Ah! Forgot the sun screen.</p>
        <p>An idiot with an ego problem, the Nightwatcher had skills, that's for sure. But seriously, he was working alone and there were so many enemies against him. How long can a lone wolf last? . Hey didn't we see these guys on Wrestlemania?</p>
        <p>Well, allow me to explain: As you all may recall, we got mutated by that strange ooze when we were only babies. There you are. I've got your pizza, are you hungry? Yep, it's finally happened. The dude has flipped his shell, what do we have to do to stop this guy?</p>
        <p>He's wrong. We're not wearing costumes, OK, so my Japanese is a little rusty. Uh, Suzuki, Kawasaki... Uhhh I left my wallet in my other shell? About 512, Sensai, I tried to get out of the way but then the building jumped out and attacked me. What do we have to do to stop this guy?</p>
