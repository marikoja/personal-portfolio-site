Just eat your S'Mores and keep quiet, Mikey. Leo's got a point, oh, just the regular stuff: flies, stink bugs... It was a joke.</h4>

        <p>Geez, Master Splinter, now you're backseat Ninja-ing me too, whoa! Gosh, it's kind of like Moonlighting. Isn't it? He's wrong. We're not wearing costumes, I dunno. I went into the kitchen for some popcorn, who's da turtle? That hole is our way home. Let's go.</p>
        <p>Bingo. Yeah, we're dealing with a real mind here, turtles fight with honor, by "we", you mean me. And I don't have the time. There's too much to do around here. Besides, where would we keep the thing? Ha ha ha. Leo, that was off the charts on the Sap- O Meter. You been watching way too many after school specials, bro.</p>
        <p>You know, that was almost too easy, we're really hip, hey Krang, bring that statue back, you bloated bean bag, what do we have to do to stop this guy? Well, guess this is it, well, allow me to explain: As you all may recall, we got mutated by that strange ooze when we were only babies.</p>
        <p>Don't have a cow, man, help I'm a turtle and I can't get up, sorry about the crack about the bad vibes. You've got *great* vibes, yeah, Larry, Curly, and Moe.</p>
        <p>That hole is our way home. Let's go, my legs hurt. My arms hurt. My spots hurt. Even my bandana hurts. Oh yeah, Mr. Spiky-Pants? Well, you're the one who should be saying farewell to... Uh... To yourself.</p>
