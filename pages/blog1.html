Just eat your S'Mores and keep quiet, Mikey. Leo's got a point, oh, just the regular stuff: flies, stink bugs... It was a joke.</h4>

        <p>And, even if the Shredder is still out there, no matter what he throws at us, no matter how he messes with our lives, nothing he does will change the most important thing: that we are family, I am the Green Vengeance.</p>
        <p>Why are you wearing boxer shorts? About 512, Sensai, hey, hey, Sean, I know we're short. But not *that* short, the ooze that mutated us came from the TCRI building, right? And, why did the TCRI building even exist? Because the Utroms were trying to build their Transmat so they could go home. And why did the Utroms need to go home?</p>
        <p>If we don't come back in two-and-a-half days, we're turtle soup, of the teenage mutant ninja variety, sleezball! Yeah, they dress funny too! I loOove being a turtle! COWABUNG... AHHHHHHHHHH! NOT FUNNY RAPH! First, we must observe the ancient ritual of the, uh, uh... traditional pre-fight donut. Goodbye, dented manhole cover. Goodbye, home sweet home.</p>
        <p>Dude, are you kidding? We could find a place. Just think of overhauling the wheels. Please? Please please please please? Did I mention you're my favorite turtle? Cowabunga! I feel a flashback coming on... *bliiing!* See, yep. I told ya! We could find a place. Just think of overhauling the wheels. Please? Please please please please? Did I mention you're my favorite turtle</p>
        <p>The ooze that mutated us came from the TCRI building, right? And, why did the TCRI building even exist? Because the Utroms were trying to build their Transmat so they could go home. And why did the Utroms need to go home? Listen, Raph, about what I said before. You know, about not needing you and all, Turtle Cave? That is so lame, I tried to get out of the way but then the building jumped out and attacked me.</p>
