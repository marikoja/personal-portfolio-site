Where do they come up with this stuff? Continuing aeration, ha ha ha. Leo, that was off the charts on the Sap- O Meter. You been watching way too many after school specials, bro.</p>
        <p>I've got it all figured out. Turbo-boosters, double-action traction, cool secret thingies shooting out the back. We should be tricking out the armored car! What's the matter, Mikey? Can't decide what to watch? don't have a cow, man.</p>
