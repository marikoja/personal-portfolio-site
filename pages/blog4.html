Just eat your S'Mores and keep quiet, Mikey. Leo's got a point, oh, just the regular stuff: flies, stink bugs... It was a joke.</h4>

        <p>Gonna miss ya, kid, "I need more power captain". The Turtle Cave must be set to maximum entertainment potential, what's the matter, dude? Haven't you seen four foot tall turtles before? Um, not to criticize science or anything, but wouldn't it be easier just to call it 'the pink one'?</p>
        <p>Mellow out, BUGS! Boy, do I hate spinach, continuing aeration. What do we have to do to stop this guy? Pizza power! I feel a flashback coming on... *bliiing!* See, yep. I told ya!</p>
        <p>Whuh-oh! It's that retro-muto-thingamabob! The School for Gifted Reptiles? I'm warning you Can Face, I've got a blackbelt in black eyes! Sorry about the crack about the bad vibes. You've got *great* vibes. A true Ninja is a master of himself and his environment, so don't forget: We're turtles!</p>
        <p>We're turtles, friend! Uh, o-hi-o, wasabi, it's like the Island of Crete, which had a labyrinth and a Menator and... Well, gang, looks like it's back to the ol' pet shop for us! . No, because an evil prisoner they were transporting across the galaxy sabotaged their starship, causing them to crash land on Earth centuries ago. And they've been trapped here ever since. And who was this evil prisoner that caused the Utroms so much trouble? He was in fact... Drumroll please</p>
